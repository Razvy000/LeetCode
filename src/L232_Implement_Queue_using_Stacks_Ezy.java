/*
 Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

 push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
 pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
 peek() -- Get the front element.
 empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
 Notes:
 You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
 Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
 You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
